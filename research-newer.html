      <h1><a id="currentresearch">Current Research &mdash; The
      Mathematics and Mechanics of Growth in Tissue</a></h1>
      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p><i>Growth</i> in biological tissue depends upon cascades of
      complex biochemical reactions involving several species, as well
      as their transport through the extra cellular matrix and
      diffusion across cell membranes. In this work, a theoretical and
      numerical framework for the macroscopic treatment of growth is
      formulated within the context of open system continuum
      thermodynamics. Assumptions central to classical mechanics being
      too restrictive to capture such detail, this treatment involves
      the introduction of additional quantities (including mass
      sources/sinks, mass fluxes, terms for energy and momentum
      transfer between species) and deduces implications for balance
      laws. The framework, consistent with classical mixture theory,
      accounts for the multiple inter-converting and interacting
      species present in the tissue. Systematic adherence to
      fundamental physical principles, such as frame indifference of
      the response in the reference configuration and non-violation of
      the dissipation inequality, result in constitutive laws whose
      forms are clearly motivated and arise naturally from the
      treatment. Notably, the transport of the extra cellular fluid
      relative to the matrix is shown to be driven by the gradients of
      stress, concentration and chemical potential&mdash;a coupling of
      mass transport and mechanics that emerges directly.</p> 
      <p>A finite element formulation employing a staggered scheme is
      implemented to solve the coupled partial differential equations that
      arise from the theory. Nonlinear projection methods are utilised to
      handle incompressibility, mixed methods for stress-gradient driven
      fluxes and energy-momentum conserving algorithms are used for
      dynamics. Our current tissue of interest being engineered <i>in
      vitro</i> tendon, the numerical examples are in this
      context. The examples serve to demonstrate aspects of the
      coupled phenomena as the tissue grows. The classes of initial
      and boundary conditions imposed, and model geometry match
      parallel experiments (which form another integral part of a
      larger project studying growth and remodelling of engineered
      tissues). Representatively, concentration or flux boundary
      conditions (tissue exposed to fluid in a bath, fluid injected in
      at the boundary) are imposed for the balance of mass governing
      the fluid phase. Conditions in an experiment being consistent
      with specification of quantities in the current configuration,
      noteworthy differences that arise when solving these equations
      in terms of quantities in this configuration, as opposed to the
      reference configuration, where the equations are initially
      developed, are accentuated.</p>
      <p>During the course of applying the theory to our system of
      interest, various meaningful modelling choices are made to
      tailor it to be representative of tendon constructs. While this
      tends to hint at a loss of generality, it is important to
      recognise that the fundamental theory and physical principles
      employed are still applicable to a larger class of problems,
      both from biology (injury mechanisms, wound healing, scarring
      and surgical repair, &#8230;) as well as from other diverse
      fields (from porous soil mechanics, to diffusion of air through
      anisotropic rubber materials in automobile tyres). With further
      refinements to the theory and concurrent maturation of the
      resulting computational framework, it is of future interest to
      extend the application of the theory to other classes of
      problems.</p> 
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <h3>1.1. Specific goals</h3>
      <p>The fundamental objectives of this research project are as
      follows:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Formulate a sufficiently general and detailed continuum
      field   theory for macroscopic growth, which includes a complete
      treatment  of mass transport coupled with mechanics, and
      implement a demonstrative numerical scheme.</li>
      <li>Make systematic and physiologically relevant modelling
      choices to tailor this general formulation to better represent
      our current tissue of interest, engineered tendon constructs,
      and use it to model and predict the response of the same.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>1.2. Background and motivation</h3>
      <p>The processes involved in the development of biological
      tissue, though numerous and involving several cascades of
      complex interactions, are generally broken down into the
      distinct processes of <i>growth</i>, <i>remodelling</i>, and 
      <i>morphogenesis</i> in biomechanics literature [<a
      href="#nn">nn</a>]. This present work treats these processes as
      mathematically independent and its focus, growth, is defined to
      be an addition (or depletion, if one is dealing with the
      converse process of <i>resorption</i>) of mass through the
      processes of mass transport and biochemical
      reactions. Additionally, this is a continuum treatment at a
      macroscopic scale, rather than at a cellular or sub-cellular
      level.</p>

      engineered tendon constructs  [<a href="#nn">nn</a>].</i><br
      /><br />
      </div>
      <p>Recognising the complexity of the system presented (that it
      is open with respect to mass and energy, and contains numerous
      species which are capable of interacting and inter-converting)
      and the limitations of classical  mechanics, additional terms
      (scalar mass sources/sinks, vectorial mass fluxes and terms for
      momentum and energy transfer between species) are introduced
      enhancing classical balance laws. The complex cascades of
      biochemical reactions are treated in an elementary fashion,
      using source-sink terms to govern inter-conversion and mass
      fluxes that supply nutrient and remove byproducts.</p>
      <p>In the context of biological growth, the notion of a mass
      source was first introduced in [<a href="#nn">nn</a>]. The
      notion of a mass flux is a more recent introduction [<a
      href="#nn">nn</a>], but this work regarded fluxes purely as
      irreversible fluxes of momentum and entropy. In 
      [<a href="#nn">nn</a>], configurational forces motivate mass
      flux where the transported species is the same material as the
      tissue itself.  These few cited examples of previous work are
      just a subset of a large body of theoretical and computational
      literature in this area. But, while the details vary, the body
      of literature represented by these works is largely based upon a
      single species undergoing transport and being
      produced/annihilated.</p>
      <p>In addition to the possibility of multiple species undergoing
      cascades of reactions, the full range of driving forces for mass
      transport, such as chemical potential gradients, stress
      gradients, external body forces such as gravity, has not been
      systematically treated previously. Most previous coupling
      between transport and mechanics has been through growth-induced
      residual stress, as described in Section  2.1.4. As indicated at
      the outset, this work is aimed at a complete treatment mass
      transport, coupled with mechanics, for the growth problem.</p>
      <p>Though the formulation is applicable to a large class of open
      systems with multiple species potentially participating in
      reactions, here it is used to model and predict the response and
      evolution of one specific tissue of interest to us, our
      engineered tendon constructs. These are functionally immature
      tendons formed by the self assembly of tendon fibroblasts <i>in
      vitro</i> [<a href="#nn">nn</a>]. Figure 1.1 shows the
      development these constructs in time. During the course of
      development of this tissue, it undergoes numerous complex
      processes, but for the purposes of this growth model, we are
      focused on the evolution of concentrations of substances such as
      collagen (see Figure 1.2), as well as their dependence on
      mechanics.</p>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><!-- <img

      <br /><i>Figure 1.2: The evolution of collagen concentration
      with age [<a href="#nn">nn</a>].</i><br
      /><br />
      </div>
      <p>There are compelling clinical reasons to study
      tendons. Tendons consist mostly of collagen and perhaps provide
      the simplest physiologically relevant setting to understand the
      chemical and mechanical factors affecting proper collagen
      deposition. Collagen is the most important structural component
      of soft biotissue. Errors in collagen deposition cause important
      types of tissue dysfunction ranging from <i>cardiomyopathy</i>
      (hypertrophy of collagen makes the heart too stiff to undergo
      proper volumetric change) to <i>hypertrophic scarring</i> in
      burns (where the morphology of collagen is whirled rather than
      aligned in overly stiff scars).</p>
      <p>Additionally, there are a large number of musculoskelital
      injuries each year which result in damage to soft tissues,
      including tendon. For tendons damaged beyond repair, replacement
      is necessary. This replacement must incorporate most native
      properties of tendon to restore function. However, such
      transplantation is limited by the availability of viable
      autograft, resulting in the use of synthetic materials which are
      unable to restore long term function due to
      incompatibility. Thus, a need exists for replacements which
      incorporate as many native properties as possible, necessitating
      a systematic study of engineered tendon.</p>
      <h2>2. Preliminary Work</h2>
      <h3>2.1. Mathematical formulation of growth</h3>
      <p>In the following sections, the basic dynamical equations of
      the continuum formulation developed from physical principles
      governing the behaviour of growing tissue are
      summarised (detailed derivations of the same can be obtained
      from [<a href="#nn">nn</a>]). Section 2.1.1 helps define the
      system and introduces fundamental quantities characterising
      it. Sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 present the balance of mass and
      balance of  momenta respectively. Section 2.1.4 describes the
      treatment of growth kinematics. Key concepts from
      thermodynamics, the conservation of energy and the entropy
      inequality, are the subject of Section 2.1.5. Finally, the
      functional forms of the constitutive relations derived from the
      Clausius-Duhem inequality are highlighted in Section 2.1.6.</p>
      <h3>2.1.1. Defining the system</h3>
      <p>The tissue of interest is an  open subset of <img

a piecewise smooth boundary. At a reference placement of the tissue,
      $\Omega_0$,
points in the tissue are identified by their reference positions, $\bX
\in \Omega_0$. The motion of the tissue is a sufficiently smooth
bijective map $\Bvarphi: \overline{\Omega}_0 \times [0,T] 
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$, where $\overline{\Omega}_0 := \Omega_0 \cup
\partial\Omega_0$. At a typical time \mbox{$t \in [0,T]$},
      $\Bvarphi(\bX,t)$
maps a point $\bX$ to its current position, $\bx$. In its current
configuration, the tissue occupies a region $\Omega_t =
\Bvarphi_t(\Omega_0)$. These details are symbolised in \mbox{Figure
      \ref{cp}}. The
deformation gradient $\bF := \mbox{\small{GRAD}}[\Bvarphi]$ is the
tangent map of $\Bvarphi$ (where $\mbox{\small{GRAD}[\textbullet]}$ is
the gradient operator in the reference configuration).</p>-->

      <p>With that brief background out of the way, we now see how classical balance laws are enhanced by addition of these sources/sink and flux terms. Without really getting into the details, I am going to present relevant equations here. The terms that show up in the equations and figures have been described in slides 49 - 52 of <a href="downloads/talks/talk3/talk3.pdf">this presentation</a>. They have been written out for a species, in the reference configuration. As a final detour before I delve into the mathematics, it is beneficial to consider the <i>continuum potato</i> description of the system.</p>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="downloads/images/cp1.png" alt="Continuum potato" title="Figure 2 - The continuum potato picture of things." />
      <br /><i>The continuum potato picture of things.</i><br /><br />
      </div>
      <p>It is easiest to comprehend the equation for the balance of mass by considering the two terms on the right hand side individually. The first arises due to the existence of a source term for the species under consideration, and the second arises due to the existence of a flux. (The negative sign arises from the convention that an outward normal is positive. And an outward flux will tend to reduce the concentration of that species.)</p>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/bomass.png" alt="Balance of Mass" title="Equation 1 - Balance of Mass" />
      <br /><i>The balance of mass.</i><br /><br />
      </div>
      <p>Similarly, we go on to see how linear momentum balance is affected by terms involving mass transport. In order to see the physical relevance, a <i>material velocity</i>, analogous to the flux in the balance of mass, relative to the solid is introduced. We then get the balance of linear momentum to be of the form,</p>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/bolm.png" alt="Balance of Linear Momentum" title="Equation 2 - Balance of Linear Momentum" />
      <br /><i>The balance of linear momentum.</i><br /><br />
      </div>
      <p>Again, it is easiest to see how this relates to classical results when each of the terms on the right hand side are analysed separately. The first two, corresponding to the body force and partial stress respectively, are classical terms. The final term is an addition in momentum to the system due to the flux of the species.</p>
      <p>Before we proceed, we realize a subtlety with respect to the <i>kinematics of growth</i>. We thus apply a suitable multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into a <i>growth tensor</i> and an elastic deformation gradient. The split will be apparent in the figure below.</p>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="downloads/images/growth-kinematics.jpg" alt="Kinematics Continuum potato" title="Figure 3 -  The continuum potato picture describing growth kinematics." />
      <br /><i>The continuum potato picture describing growth kinematics.</i><br /><br />
      </div>
      <p>Proceeding in a similar manner to what was followed for balance of mass and momentum, the (first law of thermodynamics) balance of energy is written out.</p>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/energy.png" alt="Energy" title="Equation 3 - Balance of Energy" />
      <br /><i>The balance of energy.</i><br /><br />
      </div>
      <p>We recognize the terms on the right hand side to be the stress power terms, energy loss due to heat flux outwards, energy gain due to pointwise heat generation, energy gain due to internal energy inflow, and energy loss due to flux of species outwards. Finally, we write out the (second law of thermodynamics) entropy inequality, and combine it with the energy balance equation to get the dissipation inequality below.</p>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/entropy.png" alt="Entropy" title="Equation 4 - Dissipation Inequality" />
      <br /><i>The dissipation inequality.</i><br /><br />
      </div>
      <p>Assuming a suitable constitutive hypothesis for the stored energy (that it is a function of the elastic deformation gradient, the species density, and entropy) results in the following constitutive relations in accordance with the dissipation inequality.</p>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/const.png" alt="Consitutive relations" title="Equation set 5 - Consitutive relations 1" />
      <br /><i>Constitutive relations - 1.</i><br /><br />
      </div>
      <p>The relations above are fairly standard and expected. The most interesting is the final one below.</p>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/const2.png" alt="Consitutive relations" title="Equation 6 - Consitutive relation 2" />
      <br /><i>Constitutive relation - 2.</i><br /><br />
      </div>
      <p>This relation describes how the flux of a given species relates to the different driving forces. It can be thought of as a product of a mobility and the driving forces due to various phenomena (inside the parenthesis). It is easy to imagine this in terms of a wet sponge. If the sponge is moved with an acceleration in a certain direction, the fluid it holds will be accelerated in the opposite direction. This is the first term, the driving force due to inertia. The second is plain to see. If the sponge is under the influence of a body force, say gravity, the driving force on the fluid will be along that direction. The next term is the stress gradient term (Darcy's law). If you squeeze the sponge to a certain stress state, the fluid it contains will be driven in a direction as indicated by that term. The final term can be shown to be the driving force arising from chemical potential. </p>
      <h2>Features of the Computational Formulation</h2>
      <p>In order to solve the coupled system of partial differential equations arising from the theory detailed above, a finite element formulation employing a staggered scheme (Armero [1999], Garikipati et al. [2001]) was implemented in <tt><a href="http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~rlt/feap/">FEAP</a></tt>, a general purpose finite element program. This code base is continually being refined and enhanced as our understanding of the system grows. Some of the specifics of our computational formulation include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nonlinear projection methods to treat incompressibility (Simo et al. [1985])</li>
        <li>Energy-momentum conserving algorithm for dynamics (Simo & Tarnow [1992a,b])</li>
        <li>Backward Euler for time dependent mass balance</li>
        <li>Mixed method for stress/strain gradient-driven fluxes (Garikipati et al. [2001])</li>
        <li>Large advective terms require stabilization (Garikipati et al. [2001])</li>
      </ul>
      <a id="growthvideos"></a>
      <h2>Selected Numerical Examples</h2>
      <p>For the following numerical examples, we consider systems similar in geometry, material properties and boundary conditions to our biological models &mdash; engineered tendons in fluid baths. The tendon itself is modelled as a right circular cylinder, 12 mm in length and 1 mm<sup>2</sup> in cross sectional area. The following is a representative spatial mesh used to represent it in the computations.</p>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="downloads/images/coarse-mesh.jpg" alt="Relatively coarse mesh used in computations" title="Relatively coarse mesh used in computations" /></div>
      <p>In order to visualize the results of the computations, I have also linked to videos that show evolution of various fields with time. Clicking on specially marked images below should link you to the corresponding video. The plots are generated in <tt>FEAP</tt>, and the videos from these plots were rendered using <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">Imagemagick's</a> <tt>ccnvert</tt>.</p>
      <h2>1. Tendon Growing in a Fluid Rich Bath</h2>
      <p>In this example, a biphasic model &mdash; consisting of a solid and a fluid phase &mdash; was used to represent the tendon. The solid phase is representative of the collagen and proteoglycan network, and is modelled using a nonlinear material model based on the worm like chain model. The fluid phase, representing the extracellular fluid and dissolved solutes, is modelled as an ideal, nearly incompressible fluid with the bulk compressibility of water. An artificial source term, following a simple first order rate reaction law, is used to model the creation of collagen. The fluid mobilites were extracted from literature (Han et al. [2000]).</p>
      <p>The boundary conditions, consistent with experiments, are immersing this tendon in a bath rich in fluid, i.e. the fluid concentration is maintained a constant (high) on the boundary and it is allowed to flux in through and out of all surfaces. The mechanical conditions are traction free. As we intuitively expect, we see the nutrient rich fluid diffusing into the tendon, facilitating production of collagen (growth of the tendon). The following are some results of the computations.</p>
