      <h1>Why FORTRAN should probably die, or be killed</h1>
      <p>There are many reasons why FORTRAN should probably be retired as one of the the languages most often used in scientific computing. The following[<a href="#foot1">1</a>] are a few of them, in no particular order.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Kids aren't taught to use (and therefore think in) it in school, so they have a lot of unlearning and relearning to do when exposed to their first large FORTRAN codebase.</li>
	<li>FORTRAN, as <a href="">this chart</a> shows you, was one of the earliest "high-level" languages ever designed and implemented. Though that isn't inherently a bad thing, if there's one thing you've probably realized about humans, they rarely get things right the first time (or the second, or the third... ). There are some (severe) issues relating to the way it's designed, which result(ed)s in code that's, what was later designated as, "bad programming"[<a href="#foot2">2</a>]. Learning from these sorts of mistakes, later languages have slowly tried to fix these issues, or at least, discourage such "bad programming".</li>
      </ol>
      <a id="foot1"></a>
      <p><small>[1] All these comments are made with respect to "earlier" FORTRAN specifications, and you might claim some/all of these are "fixed" in later (f77, f90, f2000... ) versions. However, since each future specification is a superset of the prior, and people don't change, all evilness present in earler versions/code have propagated relatively unharmed to the present.</small></p>
