        (Lifelong?) Improvement projects
	<br />(from a web log entry)
      </h1>
      <p><i>General cluelessness and stupidity warning - IAJAG<sup>*</sup>.</i></p>
      <p>I think a woman and a guy can be totally happy together, purely on the basis of him being her lifelong <i>(extremely hard to do, yet you can delude yourself into thinking you can) &#8220;do it yourself&#8221;</i> improvement project.</p>
      <p>And I am not kidding, I really do.</p>
      <p>There is obviously this intense need the female has, to improve aspects of her life. It can be something relatively small, like rearranging the furniture <i>over and over</i> again around her nest. But the scary part is, our male friend too can be happily clubbed into one of these <i>aspects</i>. Things can go on quite nicely, she believing he is someday going to step into that cocoon she&#8217;s built for him, the phat slug that he is now, and magically come out all pretty and butterflyey.</p>
      <p>It&#8217;s like, we&#8217;ve awakened their inner carpenter. And we&#8217;re their friendly neigbourhood hardware store&#8217;s &#8220;get everything you need in one box&#8221; project kits. I mean the workbench, the work material AND the <i>tool chest</i>. (If you&#8217;re wondering, yes. I am especially proud I thought of tool chest. And that one word, or is that two? is the only reason this post even exists.)</p>
      <p>ALL IN ONE KIT. Now which sane project doer can pass up such a deal?</p>
      <p>It&#8217;s like, they&#8217;re just greedy. They&#8217;re the bedrock of society, caretakers of our children, the ones who uphold our values and ensure harmony &#8230; . They get to CREATE LIFE and ensure perpetuation of the people, AND YET, there is still a lurking need to create. To make something out of nothing. To make something of <i>their</i> man. Sure, these occasionally lead to these spots of bother and turbulence. I mean, once in a few years you will go through the, &#8220;But but, after all I&#8217;ve said and shown you, you HAVEN&#8217;T CHANGED. NOT ONE BIT&#8221;. (At which point, you&#8217;re like.. oh..kay, so is she violent because we aren&#8217;t better men yet, or she is beating herself up for not being too good at moulding the lump of clay she was handed.) But then again, they&#8217;re patient and forgiving. So they happily <i>assume</i> in time things will be different. For all their intelligence and sensitivity, there are some things they just don&#8217;t get. </p>
      <p>We don&#8217;t change. We CAN&#8217;T change. We know this. You spend all that time and effort on attempting to improve us, but we&#8217;re not budging. Even if we do, we&#8217;ll still fake being our stupid selves. Isn&#8217;t it obvious why? That was an important component, admit it or not, of the attraction in the first place. If we&#8217;re suddenly all improved and mature and sensitive and nice and caring and clean and &#8230; where&#8217;s the challenge? We&#8217;re afraid you&#8217;ll happily move along to greener, (or is that less green) grazing grounds, and set about making them green.</p>
      <p>We&#8217;re devious about this too. We assume they will assume we will change, and be patient. And I mean very patient. Banking on this, we just be who we are. In time, biological clocks and what not, we&#8217;re hoping to hear something like &#8220;Ok, I give up, I presume this is where your evolution chose to stop&#8221;, and accept us for who we are.</p>
      <p>But then again, like I started off saying. What do I know? IAJAG<sup>*</sup>. We&#8217;re the ones who base our needs on <a href="http://scarygoround.com/index.php?date=20030923">extremely strong grounds</a>.</p>
      <p><sup>*</sup>IAJAG - I am just a guy.</p>
