        Getting your Maxtor OneTouch External Hard Drive working in Fedora Core GNU/Linux
	<br />(This isn't really hard drive or distribution dependent, though.)
      </h1>
<!--#include file="disclaimer.html" -->
      <h2>The Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Boot into Fedora, as usual.</li>
        <li>Unpack your Maxtor OneTouch External Hard Drive, plug it into the nearest power socket and connect it to the computer using the given USB cable. (I didn't try the FireWire option, yet).</li>
        <li>You can "feel" that your computer recognizes something else is in its presence.</li>
        <li>
	  Just to make sure anyway, you run
	  <div class="console">[hnarayan&#64;localhost hnarayan]$ dmesg | tail
scsi0 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
  Vendor: Maxtor    Model: OneTouch          Rev: 0201
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
USB Mass Storage device found at 2
usbcore: registered new driver usb-storage
USB Mass Storage support registered.
SCSI device sda: 490232832 512-byte hdwr sectors (250999 MB)
sda: assuming drive cache: write through
 sda: sda1
Attached scsi disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0</div>
          Voila! It sees it and all looks well. If you get a different output, don't panic yet, just type
	  <div class="console">[hnarayan&#64;localhost hnarayan]$ dmesg | grep Maxtor
  Vendor: Maxtor    Model: OneTouch          Rev: 0201</div>
          If you see this, just run the dmesg command on its own and scroll through looking carefully to where a section similar to the one above shows up. If nothing of this sort shows up, unplug, plug back in, and repeat the command. If it still doesn't show up, you're probably screwed. Or you're doing something stupid, like not turning on the power somewhere.        
        </li>
        <li>
	  In the previous step, note what it says in the second last line, <tt>sda: sda1</tt>. This just means the new hard disk is going to be referred to as <tt>/dev/sda1</tt> in computer-speak. Good, so you then type (replacing <tt>sda1</tt> below with what it told you in your output)
	  <div class="console">[hnarayan&#64;localhost hnarayan]$ su
Password:
[root&#64;localhost hnarayan]# /sbin/fdisk /dev/sda1</div>
          <p><b>Warning:</b> I've just been informed that you ought to work with <tt>/dev/sda</tt> rather than  <tt>/dev/sda1</tt> when using <tt>fdisk</tt>, otherwise it results in partitions named <tt>sda1p1</tt> and so on if you're creating multiple partitions, which don't have nodes. And that's not pleasant.</p>
          And you're in fdisk. There are a lot of things one could possibly do in fdisk (type 'm' followed by enter to see different options), but we'll stick to the basics.
	</li>
	<li>
	  First, we print the existing partition table ('p') to get this wonderful output.
	  <div class="console">     Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1p1   ?      120513      235786   925929529+  68  Unknown
Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary.
/dev/sda1p2   ?       82801      116350   269488144   79  Unknown
Partition 2 does not end on cylinder boundary.
/dev/sda1p3   ?       33551      120595   699181456   53  OnTrack DM6 Aux3
Partition 3 does not end on cylinder boundary.
/dev/sda1p4   ?       86812       86813       10668+  49  Unknown
Partition 4 does not end on cylinder boundary.</div>
For reasons best known to them, drive manufacturers seem to like to pre-partition drives in these and other different sorts of ways. Anyway, all we're going to do is delete them with the 'd' key. So you go 'd', delete partition 1, 'd' delete partition '2' and so on, until you've removed all 4. Now if you hit 'p', you get the nice blank output below.
	  <div class="console">     Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Good, now that this is an empty drive, we say 'n' and create a new primary partition. Just hit enter when it asks you about start and end blocks, as it will pick the defaults and fill the drive. Which is what I want. It will also default it to a "Linux partition" (83), and then hitting 'p' to verify this yields the output that follows.
	  <div class="console">     Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1p1               1       30514   245103673+  83  Linux</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Everything seems in order. Now we hit 'w' to write this partition table to the drive. When I did this, it complained about not being able to write this cleanly in memory, or something. No matter, shut down the machine, <b>remove the drive</b> and reboot as usual. Plug it in, and then do the dmesg thing again for good measure, if you're the careful sorts. Anyway, you then run (as root)
	  <div class="console">[root&#64;localhost hnarayan]# /sbin/mkfs -t ext2 -j /dev/sda1

</div>
          And grab yourself a cup of coffee (or two) while you're idling waiting for it to finish formatting the drive with a spanking new ext3 partition.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Back so soon? Now that it's done, we proceed to mount the drive to some nice sounding location (<tt>/mnt/external/</tt>) to be able to use it in the future.
	  <div class="console">[root&#64;localhost hnarayan]# mkdir /mnt/external
[root&#64;localhost hnarayan]# mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/external</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Again, just for good measure, we type
	  <div class="console">[hnarayan&#64;localhost hnarayan]$ df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda3             6.0G  5.6G  126M  98% /
none                  253M     0  253M   0% /dev/shm
/dev/hda2              49G   48G 1003M  98% /mnt/windows
/dev/sda1             231G   33M  219G   1% /mnt/external</div>
          That's it, you can now use <tt>/mnt/external/</tt> as any other directory.
	</li>
	<li>
          The only thing to remember here is, upto now we've not done anything to get it to 'automount' on the next and subsequent boots (if you're keeping the external drive plugged in at all times) or mount it when it is plugged in. For this, you add the last line in the following to your <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>.
	  <div class="console">LABEL=/                 /                       ext3    defaults        1 1

none                    /dev/shm                tmpfs   defaults        0 0
none                    /proc                   proc    defaults        0 0
none                    /sys                    sysfs   defaults        0 0
/dev/hda5               swap                    swap    defaults        0 0
/dev/cdrom              /mnt/cdrom              udf,iso9660 noauto,owner,kudzu,ro 0 0
/dev/fd0                /mnt/floppy             auto    noauto,owner,kudzu 0 0
/dev/hda2               /mnt/windows            ntfs    ro,umask=0222
/dev/sda1		/mnt/external		ext3	rw,noauto,user  1 0
</div>
	  With this, it's set up so that, when you plug the drive in, you can mount (and later unmount) by typing the following.
<div class="console">[hnarayan@localhost hnarayan]$ mount /mnt/external/
[hnarayan@localhost hnarayan]$ umount /mnt/external/</div>
	  And that's it, for real. I guess.
	</li>
      </ol>
