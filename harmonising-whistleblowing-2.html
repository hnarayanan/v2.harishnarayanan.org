      <h1>
        Harmonising whistleblowing
	<br />(Making sense of the cacophony)
      </h1>
      <p>The sheer number of students involved&mdash;well over 200&mdash;ensured a wide variety in points of view, and the artificial sense of anonymity they enjoyed resulted in a degree of candidness I was surprised to see; sometimes brutally so. It's like they'd forgotten I've spent a dozen or so hours with them each week, and they're really not nameless to me. Perhaps, their <em>extremely</em>-alike and hard to discern handwritings,</p>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/evaluations/comment-1.png" alt="Comment 1" title="Hmm, I wonder who this could be?" /></div>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/evaluations/comment-2.png" alt="Comment 2" title="Hmm, I wonder who this could be?" /></div>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/evaluations/comment-3.png" alt="Comment 3" title="Hmm, I wonder who this could be?" /></div>
      <p>lured them into this fictitious sense of security. Oh, the poor, misguided young'uns.</p>
      <p>Some of the responses were verbose,</p>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/evaluations/comment-4.png" alt="Comment 4" title="Yadda yadda." /></div>
      <p>while others were more wordy still,</p>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/evaluations/comment-5.png" alt="Comment 5" title="Yadda yadda. Yadda yadda." /></div>
      <p>some were terse,</p>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/evaluations/comment-6.png" alt="Comment 6" title="Ya." /></div>
      <p>a few, extremely so,</p>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/evaluations/comment-7.png" alt="Comment 7" title="Y." /></div>
      <p>but the verdict was clear&#8230;</p>
